# Breast-Cancer-Detection

This project is on 'Breast Cancer Detection' where in I have analysed the data set containing certain medical parameters through various machine learning models like :
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. Support Vector Classifier
Out of these , Random Forest Classifier yielded the maximum accuracy. I have plotted a confusion matrix and also tested the model on data with different values.
